# es6-features
Quck rundown of new ES6 features with evaluatable code blocks. 

## The code
There are currently not much in terms of build process. Minifying and dependency management is not used.
This was a quick demonstration, so i found it unnecessary. The code behind this is all made en es6 and uses no 
shims, polyfill, babel etc. Hence the following disclaimer.

## Disclaimer
The project uses no polyfills, shims etc. and will therefore only work in browsers supporting ES6.  


## Contributions
Contributions are most welcome :)
